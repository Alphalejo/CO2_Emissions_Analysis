# co2_emissions

This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across various economic sectors, spanning the years 1990 to 2022. The data covers key sectors such as energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, and residential, offering insights into their individual contributions to total global CO₂ emissions.

Trend Analysis:
How have CO₂ emissions in each sector changed over time?
What are the significant peaks and valleys in emissions, and how do they correlate with historical events or policy changes?
Sector Comparison:
What is the relative contribution of each sector to total emissions in different years?
Which sectors have been most effective in reducing their emissions?
Geospatial Analysis:
How are CO₂ emissions distributed globally?
Where are the “hotspots” of emissions, i.e., areas with particularly high emissions?
Predictive Modeling:
How can machine learning techniques be used to predict future CO₂ emissions based on historical trends?
What is the potential impact of different emission reduction policies?
Correlation Analysis:
What is the correlation between CO₂ emissions and socioeconomic factors such as GDP, population, or energy consumption?
How do CO₂ emissions correlate with climate indicators like global temperature?
Data Visualization:
How can interactive dashboards in Power BI or Tableau be used to dynamically visualize and explore the data?
What key findings can be summarized in infographics to effectively communicate the results?
